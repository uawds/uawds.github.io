The method is based on model decomposition and basis expansion. The collected hydraulic measurements, i.e., pressure and flow measurements, are deocomposed into normal measurements, measurement change due to the burst and noises. The normal measurements and measurements due to the burst are modeled by basis expansion. The regularized regression is adopted to lower the false alarm rate and improve the detectability.
